# LotCadastre(NSW)-Planning(Zoning) Intersection Incremental Update
## Background
The NSW Lot Cadastre (https://maps.six.nsw.gov.au/arcgis/rest/services/sixmaps/Cadastre/MapServer/0) is a live Geospatial layer depicting the legal boundaries of land parcels in New South Wales, Australia. It has over 3 million records and is maintained by Spatial Services (Department of Customer Services). The Zoning layer depcits the Local Environment Plans (LEP) which provide a framework that guides planning decisions for local government areas through zoning and development controls. Zoning determines how land can be used (for example, for housing, industry, or recreation). 
There is a need for an intersection of these datasets as it can provide valuable insight for planning by Government Departments.
